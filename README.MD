# Introduction
Hello, I couldn't finish this challenge due to time. I had 24 hrs to get it done, but this is how far i could go. This is done in vanilla javascript, i have already started work on the typescript version.

# Start
To start the server and the application, get into the root directory and run nodemon app. This starts up the server and connects the application to the database. 

# Problems i ran into
None perse. I just had some issues working with typescript, the server refused to start up with it. I spent virtually around 3-4 hrs. Then ran into another issue, didnt want to spend the whole day trying to figure it out, before i switched to vanilla javascript. I will be revisiting the typescript version as soon as i turn this in.

# Chipping this in
This application doesnt have a clientside, everything was done using postman. I saw that there was a figma design, but i couldn't access it. So i had to improvise with my head.

# Coclusion
24 hrs wasn't enough. And will be going back to work on the typescript version.
